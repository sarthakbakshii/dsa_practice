91 springboard

Description

The floor of 91 springboard is covered by h Ã— w square tiles, 
where there are h rows of tiles from front (first row) to 
back (last row) and w columns of tiles from left to right. 
Each tile has value of 1 to 100 written on it.

You have to walk on tiles such that sum of numbers is as 
high as possible, subject to the following restrictions:

You start by choosing any tile in the first row, and collects
 the value on that tile. Then, you move to a tile in the 
 next row, collects the value on the tile, and so on until 
 you reach the last row.

When you move from one tile to a tile in the next row, 
you can only move to the tile just below it or diagonally 
to the left or right.

Given the values of h and w, and the value on each tile, 
write a program to compute the maximum possible sum you 
can grab in one single trip from the first row to the last row.
---------------------------------------------------------
Input
Input Format :

The first line consists of a single integer T, 
the number of test cases.

In each of the test cases, the first line has 
two integers. The first integer h is the number 
of rows of tiles on the floor. The second integer 
w is the number of columns of tiles on the floor.

Next, there are h lines of inputs. The i-th line 
of these, specifies the value in each tile of the 
i-th row from the front. Each line has w integers, 
where each integer m (0 <= m <= 100) is the number 
on that tile. The integers are separated by a space character.
---------------------------------------------------------
Constraints:

1 <= T <= 100
1 <= w <= 100
1 <= h <= 100
---------------------------------------------------------
Output
The output should consist of T lines, one for each 
test case. Each line consists of a single integer, 
which is the maximum possible sum you can grab, in 
one single trip from the first row to the last row 
for the corresponding test case.
